## How to guide – Retro Reconstruction of T1 Maps for mp2rage
NB: Whilst carrying out this process you cannot carry out any scanning, this is because it will simulate an acquisition when it is carrying out this process. This is best to be done at the end of the list. 
1.	Look up the sequence that you would like to do the retro recon. 
2.	Note the full name of the sequence and time that it was acquired. (NB: when you acquire the sequence initially it is useful to put as much information in the title regarding the sequence)
3.	Press Shift and left click the waveguide symbol and the bottom right of the scan page. 
 
4.	Use the arrow buttons to scroll to the correct date and time of the sequence that you would like to do a retro reconstruction of. 
5.	Double check the name of the sequence and time. NB: The time will be slightly different but will be close to the time of the acquisition. 
6.	Select FID, please ensure that the FID that you select has the status of OK, otherwise this will fail. 
7.	Click ‘Expert Edit’, this will bring up the ‘XBuilder’. To the left there is a long list of functions that you can reconstruct, drive, acquisition, reconstruction data and the metadate of the scan data.
8.	Click onto the binoculars to search the function we would like to use. 
9.	Type in ‘ucparametricmap’
10.	Change 1 to 2 in the options brought up.
11.	Click Save (hard disk) 
12.	Close window
13.	The sequence that you have edited will now have a spanner next to it. 
14.	Click Start Recon
15.	To check this has started scroll right and it will say Calculation Started>Acquisition Done> Calculation done. 
16.	Your Retro Recon will then be saved in the Patient Browser
17.	You can send the T1 map images to ISDPACS by selecting ‘transfer’ at the top, then ‘send to’, then select ISDPACS. No need to send the INV1, INV2 or UNI images as they are already on PACS.  NB: The participants name will be a comment at the bottom of the sequence when viewing. 
18.	Check your images on ISDPACS.
