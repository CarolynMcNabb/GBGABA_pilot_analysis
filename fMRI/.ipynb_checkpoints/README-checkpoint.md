## To do:

- Motion correction

## Notes to self (private repository)

1. readout time=  ([(EPI factor (89))/(parallel image (1) )-1]*echo spacing (0.58 ms))/1000=.05104

1. Using topup to generate fieldmap results in poor bet performance on magnitude (hifi_b0) image so instead, use GRE fieldmap for unwarping

1. Unlikely to need acq_param.txt and b02b0.cnf files if not using topup for fieldmap generation

1. sub-001 does not have fMRI data
