# GBGABA_pilot_analysis
 MRI analysis scripts for Gut Brain GABA pilot 
 
 ## Proposed changes to protocol for main study
 
 1. collect SB multiband image for registration purposes
 
 1. use P>>A PE direction for multiband fMRI (eyes open resting, MB 6) - why are there 900 vols? we only need 300.
 
 1. use GRE fieldmap instead of blip up/down for fieldmap generation
 
 1. Use magnitude reconstruction and retro-recon for MP2RAGE 
 
 1. Spectroscopy still needs work
