TRPrep is what Siemens have called TR, while the TR is what they have called echo-spacing. SegLength is the Turbo Factor, which is also the number of slices, and k0 is half of that because the reordering is "Linear".

 

I don't have an example pipeline for this. It should be straightforward:

 

fslmerge -t mag ti1_mag ti2_mag

fslmerge -t pha ti1_pha ti2_pha

qicomplex -m mag.nii.gz -p pha.nii.gz -X mp2_x.nii

qi mp2rage mp2_x.nii --json=yourfile.json --beta=B

 

You will need to empirically determine the right number for beta. You want a value that removes noise in the background of the output uni image, but does not re-introduce B1 inhomogeneity. Once you have a good number it should work across all subjects.

Should be able to turn this into a python or bash script for ease of use.

qi glmcontrasts
Randomise does not save any contrast files, i.e. group difference maps, it only saves the statistical maps. For quantitative imaging, the contrasts can be informative to look at, as if scaled correctly, they can be interpreted as effect size maps. A group difference in human white matter T1 of only tens of milliseconds, even if it has a high p-value, is perhaps not terribly interesting as it corresponds to a change of about 1%. These contrast maps are particularly useful if used with the dual-coding visualisation technique.

Example Command Line

qi glmcontrasts merged_images.nii design.txt contrasts.txt --out=contrast_prefix
The design and contrasts files should be raw text (not passed through Text2Vest). One contrast image will be generated for each row of the contrast matrix.
